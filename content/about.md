This record is a trace of my rubber duck debugging.

I have seen certain results from my long-standing personal research. I wanted opinions on these results and participated in a research group. I received two major pieces of feedback. One was that the definitions of terms used in my research were ambiguous. The other was the lack of comparison with precedent cases.

Both were my shortcomings, but the latter concerned me. I had previously made comparisons with those precedent cases and could have responded orally. At least, I should have been able to. However, the words that came out of my mouth lacked logic and made for a poor response.

This indicates my uncertainty. My research is mainly completed in my head. I input books and papers and think, repeating this process. As a result, I lack a meaningful output, leading to my earlier forgetfulness and uncertainty.

A former colleague once said, "Reading enriches a person, speaking makes a person agile, and writing makes a person certain." It seems to be the words of some scholar. If this is true, then by writing, I should become certain.

I hope that language will make me certain.
