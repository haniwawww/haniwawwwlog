This log is a trace of my rubber duck debugging.

## Purpose
To solidify the uncertainty of my thoughts through language.

Having achieved certain results in my long-standing personal research, I participated in a research group. Thankfully, I received several opinions. Some of them were issues I had previously considered, and I should have been able to respond verbally. At least, that was the expectation. Although I had answers in my mind, I was unable to articulate them in language.

This was due to the uncertainty of my thoughts. My research has largely been confined to my own mind. It involved a repetitive process of reading books and papers and then thinking. As a result, I lacked a tangible output, which led to my previous uncertainty.

A former colleague used to say, 'Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.' It seems to be a philosopher's saying. If this is true, then writing should make my thoughts certain.

Hoping that language will solidify my thoughts, I create this record."
