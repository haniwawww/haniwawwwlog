This log is a trace of my rubber duck debugging.

I participated in a research group because my longstanding personal research had achieved certain results. I wanted opinions on these outcomes. Thankfully, I received several comments. All were issues I had previously considered, and I should have been able to respond orally. At least, that was the expectation. Although I had responses in my mind, I couldn't transform them into spoken words.

This is due to my uncertainty. My research has primarily been completed in my head, involving a repetitive cycle of reading books and papers and then contemplating. As a result, I lacked a tangible output, leading to the aforementioned uncertainty.

A former colleague once said, "Reading enriches a person, speaking makes a person agile, and writing makes a person certain." It seems to be a philosopher's words. If this is true, then by writing, I should indeed become more certain.

I hope that language will solidify my certainty.
